# python-workshop

Harvard FAS Informatics materials for the Python on Odyssey workshop

### Prerequisites
Workshop participants must have basic Unix proficiency, some operational knowledge of Python, and an Odyssey account.

Python basics will be covered, but not in depth.

### Code setup
Workshop participants will fork the master branch of this repository, which contains a broken script and associated module.  Participants will work off of their fork and then compare to the "production" branch to compare their final output to the properly written code.
